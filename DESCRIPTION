Title: Automatic Generation of Differential Expression Analyses
Description:
    Implements pipelines for generating differential expression analysis reports in the augere framework.
    This includes analyses with edgeR or voom-limma, with a variety of options for contrasts, blocking and covariates.
    Each pipeline function generates a self-contained Rmarkdown report with all of the steps required to reproduce the DE analysis.
