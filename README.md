# Automated generation of differential expression reports

Implements pipeline functions to generate parametrized Rmarkdown reports for differential expression analyses.
We support analyses based on **edgeR** and `voom()` with a variety of experimental designs and contrasts.
Each report contains all of the R commands required to reproduce the analysis.
